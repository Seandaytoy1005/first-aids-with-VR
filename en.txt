1022# About gas poisoning
1023#Symptoms: Gas poisoning is carbon monoxide poisoning. In mild poisoning, the patient feels dizzy, weak, nausea, and vomiting; in severe poisoning, the face and lips are cherry red, and confusion, disturbance of consciousness, dyspnea and even death may occur. Prohibition: Light an open flame or turn on the light switch at the gas poisoning site, otherwise it is easy to cause an explosion. First aid measures: Once gas poisoning occurs, immediately open the doors and windows, close the gas valve, move the poisoned person to a place where the air is ventilated, unbutton the patient's clothes to make breathing smooth, keep warm, prevent lung infection caused by cold, turn over regularly, and avoid pressure on the buttocks hurt. If the patient stops breathing, artificial respiration should be performed immediately, and if there is still no relief, the patient should be sent to the hospital for emergency treatment.
